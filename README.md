Choosing a database: Choose a database to store the patient data. Data on this stored on an excel file.

Set up your environment: Install Python on your computer and set up a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.

Create a patient model: Create a patient model to represent the patient data in your database. This model should include fields for the patient's name, age, gender, medical history, and any other relevant information.

Build a user interface: A GUI toolkit like PyQt to build a user interface for your project. This interface should allow users to enter and edit patient data, view patient records, and generate a discharge statement in PDF format.

Generate a PDF file: A PDF library like ReportLab or PyPDF2 to generate a PDF file from the patient data. This file should include the patient's name, age, gender, medical history, and any other relevant information.

Test and debug: Tested the project to make sure it works as intended. You can use unit tests and integration tests to ensure that your code is functioning correctly. You should also debug any issues that arise.

Deploy your project: Once your project is complete, create a standalone executable using tools like PyInstaller.
